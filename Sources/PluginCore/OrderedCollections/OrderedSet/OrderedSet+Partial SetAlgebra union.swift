// `OrderedSet` does not directly conform to `SetAlgebra` because its definition
// of equality conflicts with `SetAlgebra` requirements. However, it still
// implements most `SetAlgebra` requirements (except `insert`, which is replaced
// by `append`).
//
// `OrderedSet` also provides an `unordered` view that explicitly conforms to
// `SetAlgebra`. That view implements `Equatable` by ignoring element order,
// so it can satisfy `SetAlgebra` requirements.
